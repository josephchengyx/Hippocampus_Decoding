# Hippocampus_Decoding
A collection of Python/Jupyter Notebook scripts written for my Final Year Project, 'Decoding Behavioural Variables from the Population Activity of Hippocampal Neurons'.
Applies information theoretic and decoding approaches to investigate the responses of a population of hippocampal neurons in relation to various aspects of a virtual navigation task. Data files used in the scripts are generated from the [Hippocampus](https://github.com/shihchengyen/Hippocampus) repository.
